## [0.18.5] - 2026-02-25

- Moved some log messages to DEBUG and even VERBOSE_DEBUG to reduce log noise.
- Added the Observation concept and Building blocks to `cgse-core`. 

## [0.18.4] - 2026-02-13

- Updated discovery method for UI commands in the PM UI 

## [0.18.3] - 2026-02-13

- Update core services entrypoint for Logger in pyproject.toml of cgse-core
- Configurable name for the InfluxDB database
- Conditionally log debug messages based on VERBOSE_DEBUG flag in registry client/server
- Fixed problems in the PM UI

## [0.18.2] - 2026-02-06

- Allowing for "sut" instead of "camera" in setup, when submitting setup
- Bug fix in reading the HK conversion dictionary

## [0.18.1] - 2026-02-05

This is a minor update of the DAQ6510:
- Enhanced the DAQ6510 interface with default buffer usage, improved command formatting, and better response handling. 
- Introduced verbose logging for socket operations in `SocketDevice`.
- Updated sensor configuration to support multiple sensing types. 
- Added unit tests for the DAQ6510 controller and proxy functionality to ensure reliability. 
- Refactored the DAQ6510 monitoring script for better readability and structure.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-02-04

### Added

- Implementation of KIKUSUI PMX-A power supply
- The project is now licensed under the MIT license.

### Changed

- Refactoring Keithley DAQ6510
  - Synchronous device, controller, control server and monitoring needed an update. 
  - Asynchronous device and monitoring have been tested, but need an update to use the Setup for configuration.
  - set default timeout value for Keithley DAQ6510 configuration
  - set default port number of the DAQ6510 device to 5025
  - the DAQ6510 synchronous device implementation is now a `SocketDevice`

- on `cgse-common`
  - improvements to the asynchronous SCPI interface
  - some devices write an identification to the socket after connection, some devices don't. The read-after-connect can now be disabled/enabled.
  - functions to create and inspect channel lists have been added to `scpi.py`
  - `DeviceConnectionError` now also inherits from `ConnectionError`
  - `SocketDevice` has been improved and now takes into account the separator that was passed into the constructor.

### Fixed

- The SetupManager implements a lazy initialization to prevent circular imports by plugins. The default source for the Setups was not properly updated after lazy initialization. That is now fixed.

## [0.17.4] - 2026-01-27

### Added

- Extracting HK from Ariel facility database
- Implementation of Digilent MEASURpoint DT8874
- Preliminary 1st version of the TCU UI
- Added synchronous and asynchronous service connectors for robust service connection management with retry, backoff, and circuit breaker logic. These classes is intended to be subclassed for managing persistent connections to external services (such as devices, databases, or remote APIs) that may be unreliable or temporarily unavailable.
- Added SocketDevice and AsyncSocketDevice implementations. Devices that connect through Ethernet can inherit from these classes to handle their basic `read()`, `write()`, `trans()`, and `query()` methods.

### Changed

- Re-shuffled hexapod settings
- Enable TCU CS to run without core services
- Maintenance on cgse-core

### Fixed
- Cleaned up cgse-coordinates, removed obsolete settings
- Fixed timeouts and signals for Dummy device code


## [0.17.3] - 2025-11-29

In the previous release, uncommitted and untracked files were released by mistake. This release fixes this. Nothings has been changed with respect of release 0.17.2, except the removal of the uncommitted and untracked files.


## [0.17.2] - 2025-11-28

This release is mainly on maintenance and improvements to the `cgse-common` package. 

### Fixed
- Nothing needed to be really fixed.

### Changed
- To improve readability, the CHANGELOG file now contains all [link titles](https://github.github.com/gfm/#links) at 
  the bottom, both for version comparison and for issue/pull request linking. [#215]
- The args in the function `bits_set(value, *args)` should always be unpacked. Previously, the `args` could also be a 
  list, but that made the function call needlessly confusing. This should not be a problem (not a breaking change) 
  since this function is apparently only used in the unit tests currently. [#215]
- The `egse.log` module exports the logging module, so, when users import logging from egse.log, the specific CGSE 
  loggers will be configured. [#215]
- Changed the type of the default argument in `get_log_level_from_env()` function (not a breaking change) [#215]
- Changed the return value of the different `get_version_*()` functions to return "0.0.0" when the version cannot 
  be determined. Previously, these functions returned None. [#215]
- Improvements to `redirect_output_to_log()`: the file can be an absolute path, added a guard to overwrite [#217]
- A warning message is now logged when you try to read the last few lines from a non-existing file [#218]
- InitializationError = InitialisationError, to be conform to the styling guide promoting the use of standard 
  American English for code, comments  and docs [#218]

### Added
- Added a `from_string()` class method to Settings. This is mainly for testing and when you need to load 
  Settings from a specific file. [#215]
- Added an example `.env` file [#215]

### Testing
- Added a test for the `round_up()` function in `egse.system` [#215]
- Added unit tests for `egse.version` and `egse.settings` [#215], [#216]
- Fixed the test `test_quit_process()` temporarily as it is not clear on macOS what is the actual return value 
  from a process when it is terminated or killed. [#215]
- Added unit test for `redirect_output_to_log()` [#217]


## [0.17.1] - 2025-11-20

### Fixed
- Fixed a missing expanduser(). Apparently a `path.resolve()` doesn't handle the '`~`' character. [#210]
- Fixed `env_var()` which is a context manager for temporarily setting an environment variable. It uses `setup_env()` 
  to update the environment before and after the `yield`, but `setup_env()` only initializes once. [#210]
- Fixed unit tests for settings, setup, and env. [#210]

### Changed
- Some of the debug messages in settings are now filtered behind the VERBOSE_DEBUG flag. [#210]


## [0.17.0] - 2025-11-20

### Added
- Added this CHANGELOG file. [#209]
- Added an initial implementation of the ARIEL Telescope Control Unit (TCU). This is a separate package in this 
  monorepo that is located at `projects/ariel/ariel-tcu`. The package will be added to PyPI as `ariel-tcu`. [#178]
- Added a `read_string()` method to the `DeviceTransport` and `AsyncDeviceTransport` classes. [#209]
### Fixed
- Fixed the `sm_cs` for the missing `--full` cli argument. [#204]
- Fixed the configuration of the InfluxDB client. The client can now be fully configured with environment variables 
  if needed. [#206]
### Changed
- Improved initialization of the process environment with `setup_env()`. [#208]
- The configuration manager now also re-registers the obsid table to the storage. [#207]
- The `cgse` subcommand to start the notification hub is changed from `not` to `nh`. Use `cgse nh [start|stop|status]`.  [#209]
- The environment variables that contain a path can start with a tilde '`~`' which will be expanded to the user's 
  home directory when used. [#204]
### Docs
- Documentation updates for the Python version, the CLI `cgse` subcommands,  environment and the introduction of `dotenv`, ...
- Updated information on the use of `dotenv` in the developer guid.
- Added information on the environment variables to the user guide.


## [0.16.14] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- Added `cmd_string_func` parameter to the `@dynamic_command` interface. Use this parameter if you need to create a fancy command string from the arguments passed into the command function.

## [0.16.13] - 2025-10-23

### Changed
- Improved unit tests for the `mixin.py` module.

## [0.16.12] - 2025-10-21

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in starting the puna proxy.


## [0.16.11] - 2025-10-21

### Fixed
- Fixed starting the hexapod GUI by specifying a device identifier.
- Fixed registration and connection of the notification hub.
### Added
- Added a dependency for the `dotenv` module.
### Changed
- The PUNA GUI script now starts as a Typer app.
- The `get_port_number()` in `zmq_ser.py` now returns 0 (zero) on error.
- Improved logging for the Symétrie hexapods.
- Introduced the `VERBOSE_DEBUG` environment variable that can be used to restrict debug logging messages only when 
  this environment variable is set. Use this for very verbose debug logging.


## [0.16.10] - 2025-10-03

### Changed
- Renamed Settings for external logger from `TEXTUALOG_*` to `EXTERN_LOG_*`.
- The heartbeat ZeroMQ protocol now uses ROUTER-DEALER instead of REQ-REP. This was needed because too often we got an invalid state for the REQ sockets after one of the services went down.


## [0.16.9] - 2025-10-02

### Removed
- Removed caching from the async registry client.


## [0.16.8] - 2025-10-02

### Fixed
- Fixed re-registration for the async registry client.


## [0.16.7] - 2025-10-01

### Fixed
- Fixed re-registration problem in the service registry.
### Changed
- Read the Settings in the `__init__.py` files where possible. Do not spread Settings in all modules of a package.


## [0.16.6] - 2025-09-30

### Fixed
- Fixed timeouts for Proxy (sub)classes to seconds instead of milliseconds. We strive to have all timeout in seconds and only convert to milliseconds when needed for a library call.


## [0.16.5] - 2025-09-29

### Changed
- The service type for the notification hub is now `NH_CS` instead of `NOTIFY_HUB`.
- Remove the leading dot '`.`' from all startup log filenames. Startup log files are log files per `cgse` subcommand that are located in the `LOG_FILE_LOCATION`. You will find a log file there for the `start` and the `stop` for each core service or device control server.


## [0.16.4] - 2025-09-29

### Added
- Added the `bool_env()` function in `env.py`.
### Changed
- The listeners functionality has been transferred to the notification hub and services subscribe to this notification service.
- Log messages to the `general.log` file now contain the logger name.
### Removed
- Remove the listener notification from the configuration manager. 
- Remove listener registration from the storage manager and the process manager.


## [0.16.3] - 2025-09-19

### Fixed
- Fixed a circular import problem in `system.py`.


## [0.16.2] - 2025-09-19

### Changed
- The output of startup scripts is now redirected to the log location.


## [0.16.1] - 2025-09-19

### Changed
- Use the `get_endpoint()` function in Proxy subclasses.
- Define constants from settings with proper defaults.
- Cleanup port numbers for core services in Settings. All core services now have a fixed port number, which can be 
  overwritten in the local settings file.
- When `port == 0` use the service registry to get the endpoint.


## [0.16.0] - 2025-09-17

### Added
- Added a `deregister` subcommand to the service registry. Usage: `cgse reg deregister <SERVICE_TYPE>`.
### Fixed
- Fixed proper sorting of cgse subcommands.
- Fixed port numbers for core services.
### Changed
- Proxies now handle fixed port numbers properly.
- Renamed `cgse` subcommands `registry` →  `reg`, `notify` →  `not`.
