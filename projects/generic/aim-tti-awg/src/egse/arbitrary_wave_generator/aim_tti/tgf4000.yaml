Commands:

    # Definition of the DeviceInterface

    is_simulator:
        description: Ask if the connected class is a simulator instead of the real device Controller class.
        returns: bool | True if the far end is a simulator instead of the real hardware

    is_connected:
        description: Check if the Aim-TTi TGF4000 hardware controller is connected.

    connect:
        description: Connect the Aim-TTi TGF4000 hardware controller

    reconnect:
        description: Reconnect the Aim-TTi TGF4000 hardware controller.
            
            This command will force a disconnect and then try to re-connect to the controller.

    disconnect:
        description: Disconnect from the Aim-TTi TGF4000 hardware controller.
            
            This command will be send to the Aim-TTi TGF4000 Control Server which will then
            disconnect from the hardware controller.
            
            This command does not affect the ZeroMQ connection of the Proxy to the
